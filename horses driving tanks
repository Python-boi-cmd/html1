  <h1>a detailed blog about: horses driving tanks</h1>
</body>
</html>
  <p>horses driving tanks are one of many rare things you can see in the wild because, horses dont have the amount of knowledge to know how to start
    and drive tanks. Horses are also extremely smart as they can navigate through courses, and jump over obstacles. Horses can be trained to drive 
    tanks, and start them.

<h1>what would happen if horse were to actually learn how to start and drive tanks:</h1>
<p>well if horses were to actually learn how to start and drive tanks, they would also learn how to most likely find, and load in tank ammunition
    and cause World War Three.
<p>     

<p>Since Texas has the most amount of horses in the United States, and the U.S has the most horses, the Texan horses would overpower Texas, with
    a suprise attack, and would team out with the Cali Horses, to than make a large horse nation. The Cali Horses would migrate to Texas, and have
    a special meeting, using their tanks to overpower the north part of Mexico.
